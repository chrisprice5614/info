            <br>
            <p>Hey — I'm Chris Price. I'm a programmer and full-stack developer based in Spokane, Washington. I've built websites, games, mobile apps, and tools for both fun and function. I’m just as passionate about clean, thoughtful code as I am about solving real-world problems creatively.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Back in high school, I was lucky enough to win the 2018 Spokane Hackathon with Spokane Valley Tech, and I also received the Computer Science Award at my school. Since then, I’ve continued building, learning, and experimenting — and yes, I even built the very website you’re reading right now.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm always desinging and making things for my friends and I to do. Ever since I was in middle school, I'd programming multiplayer video games for my friends and I to play during lunch or recess. I learned at a very young age how networking programs are built. Even to this day, I make projects for my friends and I to mess around with. My video game, Friendmocracy, is my take on Jackbox Games, making a fun party game we can all play from our phones. When writing for the Boise Gems Drum & Bugle Corps in 2024, I was inspired by our western music sound to create a Western Arcade Shooter Game, The Game with No Name.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>What I Do</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I’ve built all kinds of things — from video games featured on my homepages to full publishing platforms. I work in web, mobile, and game development, and I’m comfortable across the stack. Whether it’s front-end design, back-end infrastructure, or stitching APIs together, I love making things that work and look good doing it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I've built and continue to maintain several websites and software solutions for businesses in the Spokane area. These websites feature strong SEO, e-commerce functionality, and analytic tracking so business owners can monitor their web traffic effectively.</p>

It’s a mix of insights, bugs I've squashed, and dev things I wish someone told me earlier. If you’re a curious coder or just want to see what I’m up to, you’ll find it all in my blog. <br><br>My music blogs are mixed in there as well!</p>
